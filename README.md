# GAN_Handwritten_Digits
### Develop a GAN for Generating MNIST Handwritten Digits
- Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are an architecture for training generative models, such as deep convolutional neural networks for generating images.
#### Steps :
1. load MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset
2. define and Train the Discriminator Model
3. Define and Use the Generator Model
4. Train the Generator Model
5. Evaluate GAN Model Performance
6. GAN for MNIST
7. Use the Final Generator Model to Generate Images
